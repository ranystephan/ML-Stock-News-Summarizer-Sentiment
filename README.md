## Usage

To use the model, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. The model can be run as a script, which takes as input a file containing a news article. The output is the summary of the article and the predicted sentiment.

python summarizer_sentiment.py --input_file path/to/news_article.txt


## Model Details

The model is a combination of a text summarization model and a sentiment analysis model. The summarization model is trained on a large corpus of news articles and uses an attention-based neural network to generate a concise summary of the input article. The sentiment analysis model is trained on a dataset of labeled stock-related news articles and uses a deep neural network to make sentiment predictions.

## Data Sources

The training data for the summarization model and sentiment analysis model come from different sources. The summarization model was trained on a large corpus of news articles from various sources. The sentiment analysis model was trained on a dataset of stock-related news articles labeled as positive, neutral, or negative.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the model:

- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
